# WarnMe App

Application made by women for women. The main goal of this application is to warn women around the world about dangerous people, places and events. It aims to make the world a safer place for those who are vulnerable. Currently still a work in progress.

The user is permitted to post their woes onto the application that utilises the blockchain to store posts made, in order to allow all users to remain anonymous. Every potential user is expected to verify themselves via a KYC system, that scans user IDs so that the verfication panel is exclusively for the users who the app is intended for. In order to combat malicious users that aim to cause chaos, we will be implementing logic where a percentage of verified users pass a vote on a particular post which facilitates the removal that bad block from the blockchain. That process will look at the block after and before the bad block and it will connect two good blocks after removing the bad block.
